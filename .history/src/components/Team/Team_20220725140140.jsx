                    <p>
                        The past few months have been a whirlwind. After collecting many NFTs from 1/1 artists and releasing my own work, I noticed a glaring struggle for artists and collectors to connect amid the noise.
                        As a collector, I love finding artist to support, but I spend too much time trying to find artist's work rather than connecting with them. By the time I find art I like, it has usually already been sold.
                        On the other hand, as an artist, I feel drowned out by the noise and constant pressure to ‘shill’ myself. Burnout feels inevitable for artists after having to take on a second, full-time marketing job to beat the algorithms of social media.
                        Artverse connects artists and collectors in the metaverse. Artverse is my solution.
